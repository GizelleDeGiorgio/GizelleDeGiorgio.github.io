    One of my favourite excersises in DGA1020 is one where we had to create our
        own still life video. It had to consist of one moving object, I had picked a clock, and objects which where able to reflect on one another. I used oranges and a glass cup.
        We had to record this setup and during the recording turn on lights from different angles so we're able to see the objects shine and reflect on one another. Then while editing the video I added some ticking noise which lined up with the clock. A cupboard opening and closing while also water running could also be heard as those where the best
        sounds to use as the video took place in a kitchen.
